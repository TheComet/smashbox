Here's the profile I'm currently using on Smash Box :pikadab:

Recommended to read through even if you end up on using  something different or
decide to lab it further.

# Version 1.22

 - Values of Tilt2 and Tilt3 swapped
 - QA angles for high% enemies super easy by just [Hold(Right + Mode) + "LS-Dpad" -> Down-Backwards]
 - Tilt2
   + Dashwalk into turnaround shield
 - Make MTilt2 the same as Tilt2 so you can initiate and complete DUZ with only right hand.
 - MTilt1
   + Works for QA trumps now

# Summary

Profile: The Amazing Pikachu
Version: 1.1
Game: Ultimate
Date: 01/10/2022
Author: WTFinland

## Pros

 - Large angle selection
 - Easy maximum distance UpB recoveries
 - Easy neutral wavebounces
 - Access for many Pikachu-specific recovery, offensive and defensive techs.

## Cons

 - Transitioning  from  landing nair (holding A) to a consistent immediate smash
   attack (mashing B) is a bit awkward.
 - No tapjump solution for IDJs.
 - Needs  additional smashbox profile for training mode, as  L  can't  be  well
   assigned to the main layout.
 - Fingers will change between Homerow and Toprow  constantly  (problem  only if
   you can only manage 'homerow layouts')

# Control setting in Ultimate:

Default, except for
 - L -> Jump
 - C-stick -> Tilt Attack
 - Dpad left/right -> Special
 - Rumble -> Off
 - Stick Jump -> Off
 - Stick Sensitivity -> High
