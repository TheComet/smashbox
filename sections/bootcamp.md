# The Boot Camp

Alright, peeps! When you start  using  Smash  Box after years of playing with a
gcc, comparatively you’ll be shit at it. It’s a new system for you to learn, so
it’ll be weird, I promise. After getting  through the initial shock, your brain
will know what the character should  do  and what buttons on the box need to be
pressed  for  that  to happen, yet still in intense situations the fingers just
might not  move  correctly  to the needed places. It will be annoying, but that
feeling of frustration will also train your brain to  do  things correctly much
faster. Grind it out! In adults, you’ll get better results within the same time
used  by  doing  a  bit  every  day  instead  of long grinds only once a  week.

There  are  things you should pay attention to from the beginning, so you won’t
need to relearn them away later.

## Learn a good posture for your hands.

Using a box controller can be more ergonomic for  your  hands  compared  to gcc
(gcc can be used quite  healthily  too  for  most, yet almost no one does), but
just as with  gcc, you’ll likely do things in an unhealthy manner on the box if
you don’t pay attention to it.

It’s  usually  much  healthier  for  you  to  float your hands above the  box’s
faceplate than resting  your  palms  on it. It will tire your arms a bit in the
beginning,  but  that’s much better than the alternative. Resting your palms to
the box while playing means your knuckles will be above your wrists. This makes
playing much more tiring and wearing for your hands and wrists.

Basically, you should play your Smash Box like you should play your piano.

You  should also do stretching and warm-ups for  your  hands  before  a  gaming
session.

In Hit Box Arcade’s Discord, use bot commands “/healthy …” for more information
and videos.

## Learn to differentiate and utilize the Tilt modifiers.

The tilt modifiers are the true challenge if you ask me, as while other buttons
just  change  places  and  their  allocated fingers when transitioning from pad
controller (and fully tilted stick translates  to  WASD  very intuitively), but
the Tilt and  Tilt2  are  two  completely new buttons with new functions, which
disrupt  the  system  you've built in your brain throughout the years. They are
better than C-Stick in most cases. You can and should use the  multi  tilts for
turnaround tilts (hallelujah for Nair loops), angled f-tilts (both 2-frames and
just ledge  trapping  becomes  more consistent), pivot cancels and dash walking
for  example.  C-Stick  is so god awfully coded in Ultimate that you are better
off  by  using  it only when your finger has a  hard  time  reaching  Downwards
quickly (like from  joystick Uair input), or when it gives you something unique
like  full  aerial  drift  u/dairs,  C-Stick  FastFalls,  IRAs or Terry’s  Coil
mechanic.

Basically, learn to  use the “joystick” as not only if you were mashing it from
the  gate’s  end  to end, but as if you could  move  it  with  the  same  speed
precisely inside the mid sections too.

You’ll  notice  that forcing out  the  walk  is  hard  in  the  beginning,  but
eventually  doing dashes close to the enemy so  you  can’t  shield  immediately
starts  to annoy you more. There are times when you want to foxtrot,  but  it’s
not when  you  need  to  space yourself around the landing enemy aerial’s range
perfectly for the punish. You might also like to  start  mixing  up  aggressive
approaches  with  tilt-induced  dash walking behind the tjolt because  you  can
react  to  an  enemy  aerial  immediately with a backdash from max  walk  speed
instead of the having  the  skid  animation  slowing  you  down. Dash dance and
punish with a tilt-induced dash attack.

## Train both the button sequences and transitioning to those sequences.

Even  I  still  sometimes  struggle  with transitioning fingers to some special
sequences from  intense situations in-game. You just gotta train those, and not
only by repeating  the  sequence  over  and  over,  but  actually by moving the
fingers  to  correct  places  from somewhere else before the  sequence  starts.

## Test out different layouts.

There is no universal optimal layout  for  Ultimate nor even for Pikachu (there
are worse  and  better  ones, however). Usually you want to have things so that
the things  you  do  most often should be easier or simpler to achieve with the
layout  you use. The base  layout  is  quite  good  for  the  majority  of  the
characters in all Smash games (I’d interchange the A and  B  since  IDJ aerials
are a thing and need 3 fingers), as many might not have any special techs which
could be made  easier  with  some  clever  unique  layout designs. For example,
Pikachu doesn’t need Z-drop that often (the layout must absolutely still enable
its use) so the required buttons  don’t need to be located for maximum synergy,
but If I mained Link, I would definitely place the buttons so that the sequence
could be easily plinked with one hand and so that it’s the most natural for the
fingers working together.

Of course, the more  you  can  stuff  good  tech synergies into the layout, the
better. But at least I’ve thought about and found  so many that it’s physically
impossible to get them all into one layout. The solution was to  ditch a few of
the  less  important  synergies for Pika, and still  ensure  that  all  of  the
possible  sequences  can  still  realistically  be  achieved with  the  layout.

Many - probably most - characters don’t really need to use all of the multi and
linear tilt  modifiers  possible,  as  multi  tilts  allow doing so many things
already.  However,  Pikachu most definitely needs all  or  almost  all  of  the
modifiers to access different angles for  UpB  and  also Thunder. I’m currently
employing like 70 different angles on my profile, and  honestly,  if  Smash Box
gets  the  ‘Mode 2’ button someday (>100 angles), I’ll probably abuse the  hell
out of them too.

Also,  keep  healthiness in mind, even when designing layouts.  Straight  quote
from Dev(s):

Also, there is one more  consideration  that  again,  not-Smash Box enthusiasts
never seem to think about, the matter of HOLDING buttons. Namely the modifiers.
This is super important, and research says that  the  job  of  holding a button
down while operation other things should go to the pinky, ring finger or thumb.

## Train Pika’s UpB angles daily.

It  feels  fundamentally  so  different from the joystick which you’ve  already
learned to time so you don’t SD. Learning the new timing rhythm for the fingers
isn't the simplest thing when there are so many buttons.

You’ll  want  that consistency  back.  And  then  you’ll  want  the  additional
consistency the box brings you, for all the UpB angle combos,  on  top of that!

## Miscellaneous

You should set SOCD option as 2nd input priority, as Pika gets a lot of use out
of  Instant  Wall  Jumps  and  B-reverses.  You  can access neutral/neutral-ish
direction frames for nairs or Z-drops with modifiers too,  and there is quite a
large amount of them for you to choose from.

People  have  different sized hands and fingers, so all layouts might not  work
for everyone even if they would work for the characters. There is also no  need
to make a layout  which  forces  your  hands  to stay locked in place. Hovering
hands also gives you better  access  for  both  Toprow and Homerow on the right
hand. I’ve seen people with so large hands that they rather had the  most  used
buttons on Toprow, so  that  they  could  comfortably  access  the thumb button
cluster. This is definitely not the case for everyone.

Being  able  to  press everything  digitally  is  weirdly  different  from  the
triggers, the joystick and the C-Stick. I never had the “problem” of being able
to press buttons too fast on gcc. Now there are cases where even if I press two
buttons at distinctly different times, the inputs get  registered  to  the same
frame.

The Sanwa buttons register the input already halfway down, so if you  want some
button to register it for only 1-3 frames,  forcing  the button completely down
won’t likely work. For that, flicking the edge of the button is more consistent
than pressing the middle part from straight above.

A  normal (non-tapjump) IDJ can be performed by either plinking the same button
with two fingers in sequence with the style  described  above.  It  can also be
done  by  sliding  a finger from a button to another if the  jump  buttons  are
assigned for the same finger, like if one is on  Toprow and another below it on
the Homerow.

Double Up Zips can happen when  you  aim  (in air) the UpB arrow to either side
with  (41,0) -directional input. You can do this zip “which doesn’t care  about
the previous zip’s angle” for both or just one zip in the UpB.

Relearning  mashing  out of grab or shield break is  important  for  high-level
play, as directional  inputs  give  you the optimal results, if done correctly.

So try, fail, lab and train, and pay attention to how you train!

Any questions, Private?
