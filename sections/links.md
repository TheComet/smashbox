## Ultimate Index for Smash Box

Whatever  you skip, don’t skip reading this.  (You  got  a  Smash  Box  without
reading this?)

Download  the  Designer  program  and  the  REQUIRED FIRMWARE UPDATE FOR  OLDER
MAYFLASH ADAPTERS (if you are using that one) from here

## Developer’s Discord

Community driven server, lots of  good info stored here and always people (devs
included) helping you through everything. Better  to ask here on things related
to you having troubles with your Smash Box or its software.

Hint: “/smashbox designer help” and “/switchsetup” are probably  the first help
commands you’ll use when Switch or the designer won’t recognize your controller
in  the  beginning.  On  PC usually it’s just not as simple as plug in and run.
Gotta  setup drivers and specify the USB COM ports and such before things start
schmoving.
