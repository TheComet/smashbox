# Pikachu on SmashBox

I prepared this thread for those of you Pika players who got their hands on the
Smash Box recently or in the near/far future :coffeechu:

The  Boot  Camp  part  could  be  useful for those who transition to any  other
rectangle controller also.

Maybe,  instead of the main channel, let’s fill  this  with  all  the  beginner
questions and group support  conversations you might have regarding using a box
controller on Pika...

...and you being bad at it

# Good to know

- Smash Box is a gamecube controller first and foremost. It can be played on PC
  but usually some additional measures need to be taken.
- You need a supported adapter to play with a Smash Box. Supported adapters are
  HitBox’s own adapter, Nintendo’s own adapters, and the Mayflash 4-port  adapter
  (firmware update needed if  it  was  made  before 2019). The reason is that the
  Smash Box needs enough power to work (5 Volts  adapter).  Some 3rd party makers
  haven’t  built  or  coded   their   equipment  along  the  Nintendo  standards.
- Since Smash Box needs the full power access, you have to have both USB cables
  connected.
- You  can have 3 profiles on the box simultaneously which can be switched from
  the side of the box. A profile in this  case  means button layout + directional
  input coordinate mappings. As of writing  this,  the  SOCD option you’ve chosen
  runs the same  on  all the profiles. You can’t have separate ones for different
  profiles.
- Normal modifiers have two types. There are Linear Tilt Modifiers  and  Multi
  Tilt Modifiers. The Linear Tilts affect  only  either x- or y-axis, while Multi
  Tilts affect both. If a Linear Tilt and Multi Tilt are active at the same time,
  the  Linear Tilt overrides the Multi Tilt’s effect for  the  axis  it  affects.
  Also, there is a modifier fusion effect in place so that pressing X1/Y1/Tilt1 +
  X2/Y2/Tilt2 results in X3/Y3/Tilt3.
